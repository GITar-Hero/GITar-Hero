Git creates a new snapshot\r\n            that results from a three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is\r\n            referred to as a merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent. A three-way\r\n            merge uses the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>You may want to make a non-fast-forward merge that creates a merge commit even if it is possible, to simply\r\n          move the branch pointer forward. You can force git to do that with <span className='help-container__git-command'>\r\n            git merge --no-ff [branchX]</span>. This is often used while merging a topic branch into main branch.</p>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'HEAD',\r\n    content: <div>\r\n      <p>Git keeps a special pointer called HEAD. It points to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer\r\n        to the last commit made on that branch. Whenever the HEAD pointer is moved git records it in a log. You can\r\n        check how it's position has changed with <span className='help-container__git-command'>git reflog</span>.</p>\r\n      <p>You can refer to an ancestor of a commit HEAD is referencing. For example 'HEAD~' refers to a first ancestor of\r\n        HEAD. You can use that with a number, for example 'HEAD~3' is equivalent to 'HEAD~~~' and means grand\r\n        grandfather of commit pointed by HEAD.</p>\r\n      <p>Command <span className='help-container__git-command'>git checkout [branch]</span> does two things.\r\n        HEAD pointer is moved back to point to that branch and files in your working directory are reverted back to\r\n        the snapshot that branch points to.</p>\r\n      <p>When you checkout to a commit you are in a detached HEAD state. This means that HEAD pointer doesn't point to\r\n        any branch but to a specified commit. Commits made in detached HEAD state don't belong to any branch and might\r\n        be lost.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'reset',\r\n    content: <div>\r\n      <p>Reset command can be used to accomplish different things. You can use it to remove commits, unstage files or\r\n        undo changes in your working directory. It resets current HEAD (read more: HEAD) to the specified state - in\r\n        other words it moves HEAD pointer to a specified commit and can modify staging area and working directory.</p>\r\n      <p>Command <span className='help-container__git-command'>git reset</span> can be run with one of three options:\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li><b>--soft</b> - only moves a HEAD pointer and doesn't affect staging area or your working directory.</li>\r\n          <li><b>--mixed</b> - this is a default option. In addition to moving HEAD, it also changes index file\r\n            (where all staged files are - so in other words your staging area) to be like it was in a commit a HEAD\r\n            pointer just moved to.</li>\r\n          <li><b>--hard</b> - it moves HEAD pointer and reverts files back to a specified snapshot, but this time it\r\n            affects not only your staging area but also your working directory. Be careful with this option, because\r\n            it may cause you lose your work (even commited).</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>You can unstage a file with <span className='help-container__git-command'>git reset [filename]</span>. This command is equivalent\r\n          to <span className='help-container__git-command'>git reset --mixed HEAD [filename]</span>. It changes only your staging area.\r\n          If you run this command without specifying a file, all your changes will be unstaged.</p>\r\n        <p>Although <span className='help-container__git-command'>git reset --hard [commit]</span> can cause some damage, it might also be very\r\n          helpful. If you want to revert and delete a commit you're currently on and return to a state saved in a previous one, you can\r\n          accomplish it with <span className='help-container__git-command'>git reset --hard HEAD~</span>. For example, this can be used to\r\n          revert a merge action.</p>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'rebase',\r\n    content: <div>\r\n      <p>Rebase is a procedure of changing commit’s parent. Assume that you started a feature\r\n        branch from develop. Before you merged your branch, someone else committed to develop.\r\n        If you want to keep incremental history of project, you want your branch look like it\r\n        started from current develop. So you take first commit you made on your branch and change\r\n        it’s parent to last commit on develop. Of course you have to resolve possible conflicts\r\n        in project's source.</p>\r\n      <p>Type <span className='help-container__git-command'>git rebase [branchX]</span> to rebase current branch onto branchX\r\n        or <span className='help-container__git-command'>git rebase [branchX] [branchY]</span> to rebase branchY onto branchX.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'remote repos',\r\n    content: <div>\r\n      <p> Remote repositories (remotes) are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network\r\n        somewhere.

It also set up your local master branch to track the remote master\r\n        branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. A repository created with\r\n        <span className='help-container__git-command'>git init</span> doesn't have any remotes or tracking branches\r\n        added by default.</p>\r\n      <p>To add a remote use <span className='help-container__git-command'>git remote add [name] [url]</span>.</p>\r\n      <p>Remove a remote with <span className='help-container__git-command'>git remote rm [name]</span>.</p>\r\n      <p>When you commit your changes they are saved in your local repository. Most of git operations affect only your\r\n        local repo.

Usually you also want to merge it with your\r\n        local repo. There is a command that does both fetching and merging - <span className='help-container__git-command'>\r\n          git pull [remote] [remotebranch]</span>. Running it generally fetches data from specified remote repo and\r\n        automatically tries to merge it into your local branch.</p>\r\n      <p>By default, after fetching data, pull command runs <span className='help-container__git-command'>git merge\r\n        </span> to merge the retrieved branch into the current one.

The command for\r\n        this is simple: <span className='help-container__git-command'>git push [remote] [remotebranch]</span>.\r\n        But it works only if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you have an outdated version of remote repo, your\r\n        push will be rejected. First you’ll have to fetch the changes you don't have and merge them with yours before\r\n        you’ll be allowed to push.</p>\r\n      <p>When you're on a local branch that tracks a remote branch you can run <span className='help-container__git-command'>\r\n        git push</span> without any parameters. Git knows exactly to which\r\n        remote and which branch it should push.</p>\r\n      <p>If you want your local branch to track a specific remote branch, you can set it while pushing to a remote with\r\n        <span className='help-container__git-command'>git push -u [remote] [remotebranch]</span>.

Such tags can also\r\n            have a tagging message. It’s generally recommended to create annotated tags to have all this information.\r\n            The easiest way to create it is to specify -a when you run the tag command.
